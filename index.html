        <p>He lived with his parents before he was sent away on his 7th birthday. His father allegedly wanted to eat him by bathing him in barbecue sauce and making him sleep with an apple in his mouth, a memory that might cause his own trauma and his fear of fatherhood.

        <p>Shrek lived alone in a swamp in the middle of the forest. At first, he appears to like his privacy and enjoys scaring people, but never harmed them. He enjoyed his own life at his home like taking mud baths, brushing his teeth with bug paste to make breath nastier and stinkier, and farting in his pool. Even though his background is unknown, it is assumed that most ogres harm people, although Shrek wasn't violent, yet he was still thought of as an evil, intimidating, and hideous ogre to most. He does woodwork sometimes.</p>

        <p>Shrek was DreamWorks' way of punishing their crew, mainly those who failed their tasks in the production of "Prince of Egypt".
DW assumed that the movie would be a box-office loser, and was prepping it as a tax write-off. They called the process of being transferred to the Shrek production team "Getting Shrek'd".</p>
